## What is Umami

[Ummai](https://umami.is/) is an <span class="font-semibold text-primary">open-source</span>, self-hosted web analytics platform that allows
you to collect and visualize data about your website or application's traffic, engagement, and behavior. Unlike traditional analytics tools like Google
Analytics, which rely on third-party tracking scripts and store user data in the cloud, Umami stores all of its
data locally on your own server. This provides greater control over your data, as well as a higher level of
security and transparency. With Umami, you can track page views, unique visitors, bounce rates, and other key
metrics, giving you a more nuanced understanding of how users interact with your site.

### Exploring the Features

Before we dive into installing Umami on Docker, you might be curious about what it's like to use in action.
The Umami website offers a live demo where you can explore its features and get a sense of how it works.
We encourage you to try it out – simply navigate to the demo page, log in with a test account, and start
exploring the dashboard. With this hands-on experience under your belt, you'll be better equipped to follow
along as we guide you through installing Umami on Docker.

### Installation

Now that you're familiar with what Umami offers, it's time to get started with installing your own instance.
The easiest way to do this is by using Docker Compose, a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker
applications. With Docker Compose, you can spin up an Umami instance with just a few commands.

To get started, create a new file named `docker-compose.yml` in the root of your project directory with the following contents
(you can check it on [github](https://github.com/umami-software/umami/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)):

```yml showLineNumbers title="docker-compose.yml" /umami:umami/#ob /replace-me-with-a-random-string/#ob /POSTGRES_USER: umami/#ob /POSTGRES_PASSWORD: umami/#ob
version: '3'
services:
  umami:
    image: ghcr.io/umami-software/umami:postgresql-latest
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      DATABASE_URL: postgresql://umami:umami@db:5432/umami
      DATABASE_TYPE: postgresql
     APP_SECRET: replace-me-with-a-random-string
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
    init: true
    restart: always
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "curl http://localhost:3000/api/heartbeat"]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5
  db:
    image: postgres:15-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: umami
      POSTGRES_USER: umami
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: umami
    volumes:
      - umami-db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    restart: always
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U $${POSTGRES_USER} -d $${POSTGRES_DB}"]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5
volumes:
  umami-db-data:
```

This Docker Compose file defines two services: `db` and `umami`. The `db` service uses the official
Postgres image, while the `umami` service uses the official Umami image with PostgreSQL support.

Make sure to replace the highlighted parts with a more secure strings.

To run your Umami instance, navigate to the project root and execute the following command:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will start both services in detached mode. Your Umami instance is now running on port 3000!
Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the dashboard.

Note that this setup uses a volume for persistent data storage, so your database will persist
even after you stop the container.

## Configuring Umami

Now that you have Umami up and running, it's time to configure it for your needs. By default,
Umami comes with a basic setup, but you can customize many aspects of the platform to suit your requirements.

Next, navigate to the Umami dashboard by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser. Log in using the
default credentials (`admin` for username and `umami` for password), then change the password immediately to ensure security.

## Adding Umami to Sveltekit

To integrate Umami with your SvelteKit project, we'll create a custom component and store to handle
tracking codes instead of using the default `script` tag provided by Umami. This approach offers
more flexibility and control over how you manage analytics in your application.

By creating a reusable `&lt;Umami/&gt;` component and a corresponding `umamiStore`, we can easily
inject the tracking code into our SvelteKit pages without cluttering our markup with unnecessary
HTML tags. This design choice also allows for easier maintenance and updates to your Umami configuration.

### Umami Store

To manage the state of your Umami instance, we'll create a `umamiStore` using Svelte's built-in store system.
The store will keep track of two essential properties: whether analytics are enabled and the current status of the tracking code.

```ts showLineNumbers title="umami.svelte.ts"
import { writable } from 'svelte/store';

const lastStatus: boolean =
	typeof localStorage !== 'undefined'
		? JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('umami') || '{"enabled": true}').enabled
		: true;

export const isEnabled = writable<boolean>(lastStatus);

isEnabled.subscribe((value) => {
	if (typeof localStorage !== 'undefined') {
		localStorage.setItem('umami', JSON.stringify({ enabled: value }));
	}
});

export const status = writable<undefined | 'mounted' | 'removed' | 'loaded' | 'error'>(undefined);
```

This store allows you to easily display a privacy modal or error message to the user based on the
current status of the tracking code. For example, when analytics are activated, you can show a
reminder about data collection, while an `error` status can trigger a notification about a tracking
issue. This way, you can provide a seamless user experience and maintain transparency about how
your app handles data.

### Umami Component

To integrate Umami into your SvelteKit application, we'll create a custom `&lt;Umami/&gt;` component.
This component will handle the loading and initialization of the tracking code, as well as
updating the status store to reflect changes in the tracking code's state.

The component uses Svelte's built-in lifecycle methods (`onMount` and `onDestroy`) to manage the script's
insertion and removal from the DOM, ensuring that it only loads when necessary. When the script
is loaded, the component updates the `status` store with a `loaded` status, indicating that tracking has begun.

The component also includes error handling, which sets the `status` store to an `error` status when any issues
occur during loading. This allows you to display a notification or alert the user about the issue.

Finally, the component conditionally loads the Umami script only in browser environments and when analytics
are enabled, ensuring that it doesn't load unnecessarily.

```svelte showLineNumbers title="Umami.svelte"
<script context="module" lang="ts">
	import { status } from '$lib/stores/umami.svelte';
	status.set(undefined);
	declare let window: WindowWithUmami;
</script>

<script lang="ts">
	import { BROWSER } from 'esm-env';
	import { onDestroy, onMount } from 'svelte';

	import { dev } from '$app/environment';
	import type { WindowWithUmami } from '$types/umami';

	export let websiteID: string;
	export let srcURL: string;

	onMount(() => {
		if (
			BROWSER &&
			document.getElementById('umami_analytics_script') !== null &&
			$status !== 'loaded'
		) {
			$status = 'mounted';
		}
	});

	onDestroy(() => {
		if (BROWSER) {
			const script = document.getElementById('umami_analytics_script');
			if (script !== null) {
				script.remove();
				$status = 'removed';
				window.umami = undefined;
			}
		}
	});

	let shouldInitialize = [undefined, 'removed', 'error'].includes($status);

	function scriptLoaded() {
		$status = 'loaded';
	}

	function errorHappened() {
		$status = 'error';
	}
</script>

<svelte:head>
	{#if shouldInitialize && !dev}
		<script
			async
			defer
			id="umami_analytics_script"
			data-testid="umami_analytics_script"
			src={srcURL}
			data-website-id={websiteID}
			on:load={scriptLoaded}
			on:error={errorHappened}
		></script>
	{/if}
</svelte:head>
```

```ts showLineNumbers title="umami.ts"
export interface WindowWithUmami extends Window {
	umami: unknown | undefined;
}
```

### Use component in the root layout

To complete the integration, navigate to your +layout.svelte file (usually located at the root of
your project) and add the `&lt;Umami/&gt;` component. The component
expects two props: `websiteID` and `srcURL`, which should be passed in from your app's configuration or env.

- `websiteID`: is the unique identifier of your Umami instance, which was saved during the Umami settings process
- `srcURL`: is the URL where your Umami instance lives

```svelte title="+layout.svelte"
<script lang="ts">
	import { Umami } from '$components/shared/misc';
	import { env } from '$env/dynamic/public';

	let { children } = $props();
</script>

<Umami websiteID={env.PUBLIC_UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID} srcURL={env.PUBLIC_UMAMI_SERVER_REMOTE} />
```

## Conclusion

With this integration complete, you'll have a seamless way to monitor user behavior on your SvelteKit
application, providing valuable insights to inform future development decisions. By leveraging the
power of Umami's open-source analytics platform, you can maintain transparency with your users while
gaining a deeper understanding of their interactions with your site.
